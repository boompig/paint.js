Paint.js
====================

This is a Paint-clone, though better designed, meant to be run in a browser using the HTML5 canvas.
Submitted for a U of T undergrad course, I wanted to make this an open-source project, for anyone to use, view, and modify as they please. Though I'd like credit =)

This project was written in entirety by me, Daniel Kats. Please, hold your applause.

## Instructions

### Drawing Shapes

Drawing shapes is almost identical to MSPaint or any other drawing program.

1. Select a shape from the left sidebar (one of line, circle, rectangle)
2. Click and drag on the canvas to create the shape, release the mouse button to finish

### Changing Existing Shapes

To change a shape that is already on the canvas, you need to select it with the select tool in the left sidebar.

* To change the colour of a shape, change the colours in the right sidebar. Then press the 'Apply' button
* To change the line width of a shape, change the line width in the right sidebar. Then press the 'Apply' button
* To resize a shape, drag one of the (blue) resize circles, located on the shape vertices
* To move a shape, click within the shape, then drag and drop
* To erase a shape, click the 'Erase Shape' button in the left sidebar
* To copy a shape, click the 'Copy Shape' button in the left sidebar. The new shape will appear next to the previously selected shape
