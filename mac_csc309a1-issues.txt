Differences between Chrome and FF (Mac):
	- FF:
		- colour preview canvas doesn't update even though change event registers and shape is redrawn
			- HOWEVER: 
				- updates on ALT+TAB
				- works when debug point set in firebug
				- works on Chrome
		
		-  preview layer doesn't add a shape when moving mouse around (though only tried w/ trackpad)
			- HOWEVER:
				- works on Chrome (kind of)
				
	- Chrome
		- rectangles don't fill on main canvas
			- HOWEVER:
				- works on FF
				- works on colour preview canvas (and the same code is used in both places)
				- doesn't occur for circles
