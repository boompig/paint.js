Differences between Chrome and FF (Mac):
	- FF:
		- colour preview canvas doesn't update even though change event registers and shape is redrawn
			- To reproduce:
				- select a shape on the canvas (using select tool)
				- click 'Random fill colour' button
				- notice small preview canvas does not change colour
		
			- HOWEVER: 
				- updates on ALT+TAB
				- works when debug point set in firebug
				- works on Chrome
		
		-  preview layer doesn't add a shape when moving mouse around (though only tried w/ trackpad)
			- To reproduce:
				- start drawing a tool on the canvas
				- notice that shape does not extend all the way to mouse pointer
		
			- HOWEVER:
				- works on Chrome (kind of)
				
	- Chrome
		- creates filled rectangles instead of circles??? 
			- To reproduce:
				- try drawing a circle
		
			- HOWEVER:
				- works on FF
				- works on colour preview canvas (and the same code is used in both places)
				- doesn't occur for circles
